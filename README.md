# double-pendulum-chaos-fractal/map
Dp chaos fractal/map
The program is wrapped in |pi,pi| so it will be more like a map than a fractal 
Minimalist apprach to gui and physics 
The minimalist physics is approached with help of Lagrangian Machanics 
Lagrangian Machanics : Easier to compute some (like max(1,2,3)) differential equations so easier for machine to handel. Newtonian machanics would be very difficult here
